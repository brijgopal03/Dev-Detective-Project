# Dev Detective

Dev Detective is a web application that allows users to search for any GitHub profile and view detailed information about the repositories, followers, and more. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the GitHub API to retrieve and display public information available on the user's GitHub profile.

## Features

- Search for any GitHub profile by username.
- Displays detailed information about repositories, followers, following count, and profile bio.
- Shows user's location, Twitter handle, company details, and blog if available.
- Automatically displays the developer's own GitHub profile upon startup.
- Dark and light theme switcher for a customizable user experience.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the app and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core logic for fetching data from the GitHub API and updating the UI dynamically.
- **GitHub API**: Provides all public information of GitHub profiles.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/brijgopal03/Dev-Detective-Project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Dev-Detective-Project
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

4. Enter a GitHub username in the search bar and click "Search" to view the profile details.

## API Setup

The project uses the GitHub API, which doesn't require an API key for basic profile requests. However, for extended usage or higher request limits, you can authenticate with your GitHub credentials. 

More about the GitHub API can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
